        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>2 ounces cream cheese, very soft</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>
                Beat egg whites and cream of tartar together in a bowl until stiff peaks form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix egg yolks, cream cheese, and sugar together in a separate bowl using a wooden spoon and then mixing with a hand-held egg beater until mixture is very smooth and has no visible cream cheese. Gently fold egg whites into cream cheese mixture, taking care not to deflate the egg whites.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully scoop mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, forming 5 to 6 "buns".
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cloud bread is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
