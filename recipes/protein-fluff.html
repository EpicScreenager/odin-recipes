        <h2>Description</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>25g protein powder of your choice</li>
            <li>5g Xanthan Gum</li>
            <li>280ml diet cream soda</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional toppings:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ice cream wafer</li>
            <li>99 flake</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the protein powder and xanthan gum and mix.</li>
            <li>
                Add one third of the diet cream soda and whisk for 2-3 minutes using an electric whisk. It's really important that you use an electric whisk here (you'll be whisking for an eternity if you do it by hand)
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually pour in the remaining soda whilst whisking. Whisk for around 10 minutes in total and watch your fluff quadruple in size. Stick with it â€“ it will grow!
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a wafer and a flake, or your favourite toppings, or just spoon straight out of the bowl
            </li>
        </ol>
